# Metacritic_score_analysis

I will collect data from metacritic and use it to check my hypothesis for dsa 210 term project.

**Data collecting method**

I will use data scraping script to collect data from metacritic. Name, release data, developer name, publisher name, expert score, player score etc.

**hypothesis 1**
Expert giving more score recent year than before. I can check this by comparing average score by years.

**Hypothesis 2**
Players give lower score than experts. I will check by comparing the games average player score to expert score.
